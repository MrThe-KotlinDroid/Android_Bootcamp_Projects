# Android Bootcamp Projects ðŸš€

Welcome to my **Android Bootcamp Projects** repository! This is where Iâ€™m documenting my journey through a structured Android development program. The goal is to build a solid foundation, create some cool projects along the way, and eventually level up my skills to become a professional Android developer. Here, youâ€™ll find my progress, projects, and a little bit about what Iâ€™ve learned.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The projects in this repository are organized into categories based on difficulty and complexity:

1. **Beginner Projects**  
   - Focus on basic concepts and foundational skills, primarily working with UI and simple functionality.
2. **Intermediate Projects** *(Coming Soon)*  
   - Will cover more complex topics such as networking, data storage, and more sophisticated app features.
3. **Advanced Projects** *(Coming Later)*  
   - Will involve real-world projects with comprehensive functionality, testing, and possibly deployment.

## ðŸŒ± Current Progress

### Beginner Projects
1. **Getting Started with Android**  
   - First simple app to get familiar with Android Studio and basic Android development.

2. **Motivational Quote App**  
   - A basic app displaying motivational quotes, aimed at practicing UI layout and text views.

3. **BMI Calculator**  
   - An app for calculating BMI, exploring XML layouts, input handling, and Java basics.

4. **The Hungry Developer App**  
   - This app was a great introduction to Android's fundamental concepts. I learned how to work with activities, manage dependencies using `build.gradle`, and create dynamic layouts using `RelativeLayout`, `CardView`, and `ScrollView`.
   - I also delved into Android's data structures by creating arrays for storing data, used `ArrayAdapter` for adapting data into views, and explored how to handle user navigation between different screens using intents.
   - This project helped solidify my understanding of essential programming concepts like loops, classes, objects, and array handling while building a multi-screen experience.

5. **My Bucket List App**  
   - In this challenge project, I explored Androidâ€™s layout components like `LinearLayout` and advanced UI elements such as `RatingBar`. I learned about styling UI elements, using drawable resources, and understanding how to apply gradients to views.
   - This app also introduced me to basic data management concepts, allowing users to create, view, and manage items on their bucket list.

## ðŸ“ˆ What's Next?

Iâ€™ll keep adding new projects and updating this repository as I continue to learn and improve. The next steps will dive deeper into Android-specific features, building more advanced apps, and refining the skills Iâ€™ve acquired.
